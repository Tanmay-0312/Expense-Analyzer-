# Expense-Analyzer-
Personal Finance Tracker and Savings Predictor in Python

Expense Analyzer

A Python-based interactive program that helps you analyze, visualize, and plan your personal finances — including expenses, savings goals, and “what-if” scenarios using matplotlib graphs.

📘 Features

✅ Expense Tracking – Add all your monthly expenses and categorize them easily.
✅ Expense Visualization – View income vs. expenses and expense breakdown using bar and pie charts.
✅ Essential vs Non-Essential Analysis – See how much of your spending is essential vs. optional.
✅ Savings Projection – Predict your savings for upcoming months based on your current spending pattern.
✅ What-If Scenario – Simulate the effect of reducing non-essential expenses (e.g., 20% cut) on your savings.
✅ Savings Goal Tracker – Set a goal and find out how long it’ll take to reach it with your current savings.

🧮 How It Works

Enter your monthly income.

Add all your expenses one by one (e.g., Rent, Food, Shopping, etc.).

Mark which expenses are essential.

The program automatically:

Calculates total spending and savings.

Displays your biggest and smallest expense.

Shows bar and pie charts for visual understanding.

Optionally, you can:

Forecast future savings.

Simulate savings if you reduce non-essential expenses.

Set a savings goal and see how long it will take to achieve it.

📊 Graphs & Charts

Income vs Expenses – Bar chart

Expense Distribution – Pie chart

Savings Projection – Line chart

What-If Analysis – Compare current vs. improved savings

Goal Comparison – See your projected savings vs. your goal visually

🧠 Example
Enter your monthly income: 50000  
Ok so how do you spend your salary? (Type 'Finished' when done)  
Rent → 15000  
Groceries → 8000  
Entertainment → 5000  
Transport → 3000  
Finished  

Income vs Expenses → [Bar Chart shown]  

Essential expenses → Rent, Groceries, Transport  
Non-essential → Entertainment  

Would you like to see future savings for 6 months? → Yes  
[Line chart shows savings projection]  

What if you reduce non-essential expenses by 20%? → [Green line shows new projection]
